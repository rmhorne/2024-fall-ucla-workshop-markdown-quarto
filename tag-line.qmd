# Markdown, Zotero, and Quarto for Academic Writing and Publishing

This workshop is designed to introduce researchers to digital writing and publishing with the flexible tools of Markdown and Quarto. Participants in this hands-on session will cover the fundamentals of Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows users to write, structure, and reuse their writing and research. We will then introduce Quarto, a powerful publishing system which can transform Markdown documents into academic publications, websites, presentations, and more. The workshop will show how citation management systems such as Zotero can be integrated with Quarto, and how tools like VS Code and Jupyter notebooks can be used to create an efficient, reproducible, and versatile academic publishing pipeline.
